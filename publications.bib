  abstract = {The electrochemical control of ion migration is fundamental to the development of oxide memristors and neuromorphic devices. Among them, oxygen-ion-based electrochemical random-access memory (ECRAM) offers low variability and high training accuracy, making it suitable for analog in-memory computing. However, conventional vertically-stacked ECRAMs hinder real-time visualization of ion migration paths, limiting further device optimization. Here, an independently-contacted, reciprocally-switching double-layer ECRAM (IRIS-ECRAM) is introduced that enables simultaneous measurement of conductance changes in both the channel and reservoir layers. This design allows direct mapping of oxygen vacancy migration within the device, revealing opposing switching behavior between the two layers and identifying a new role of the electrolyte as a temporary reservoir. Furthermore, array-level operation, confirming the scalability of the proposed design, is demonstrated. This platform is universally applicable to various ECRAM structures and provides a powerful tool for understanding ionic dynamics and guiding structural optimization based on oxygen vacancy mapping.},

  abstract = {Out-Of-Domain (OOD) generalization is a significant challenge in learning dynamical systems, especially when they exhibit bifurcation, a sudden topological transition triggered by a model parameter crossing a critical threshold. A prevailing belief is that machine learning models, unless equipped with strong priors, struggle to generalize across bifurcations due to the abrupt changes in data characteristics. Contrary to this belief, we demonstrate that context-dependent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), trained solely on localized, pre-bifurcation, symmetric data and without physics-based priors, can still identify post-bifurcation, symmetry-breaking behaviors, even in a zero-shot manner. We interpret this capability to the model's implicit utilization of topological invariants, particularly the Poincar\'e index, and offer a formal explanation based on the Poincar\'e--Hopf theorem. We derive the conditions under which NODEs can recover---or erroneously hallucinate---broken symmetries without explicit training. Building on this insight, we showcase a topological regularizer inspired by the Poincar\'e--Hopf theorem and validate it empirically on phase transitions of systems described by the Landau--Khalatnikov equation.},

  abstract = {There is a growing consensus that the physics-based model needs to be coupled with machine learning (ML) model relying on data or vice versa in order to fully exploit their combined strengths to address scientific or engineering problems that cannot be solved separately. We propose several methodologies of bridging technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation and artificial intelligence (AI) with its application to the tasks for which traditional TCAD faces challenges in terms of simulation runtime, coverage, and so on. AI-emulator that learns fine-grained information from rigorous TCAD enables simulation of process technologies and device in real-time as well as large-scale simulation such as full-pattern analysis of stress without high demand on computational resource. To accelerate atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we have done a comparison study of descriptor-based and graph-based neural net potential, and also show their capability with large-scale and long-time simulation of silicon oxidation. Finally, we discuss the use of hybrid modeling of AI- and physics-based model for the case where physical equations are either fully or partially unknown.},

  abstract = {Charge storage synaptic circuits employing InGaZnO thin-film transistors (IGZO TFTs) and capacitors are a promising candidate for on-chip trainable neural network hardware accelerators. However, IGZO TFTs often exhibit bias instability. For synaptic memory applications, the programming transistors are predominantly exposed to asymmetric off-state biases, and a unique field-dependent on-current reduction under off-scenario is observed which may result in programming current variation. Further examination of the phenomenon is conducted with transmission line-like method and degradation recovery tests, and current reduction can be attributed to contact resistance increase by charge trapping in the source and drain electrode and the channel region. The current decrease is subsequently formulated with a stretched exponential model with bias-dependent parameters for quantitative circuit analysis under off-state degradation. A neural network hardware acceleration simulator is utilized to assess the complicated impact the off-state current degradation could instigate on on-chip trainable IGZO TFT-based synapse arrays. The simulation results generally demonstrate deteriorated training accuracy with aggravated off-state instability, and the accuracy trend is elucidated from the perspective of weight symmetry point.},

  abstract = {Recently, it has been shown that the mobility of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) depends strongly on channel thickness and metal composition (In/Ga/Zn), resulting in a mobility-threshold voltage (Vth) trade-off. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first comprehensive modeling study systematically integrating density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potential (MLP) to capture structural disorder and thickness effects on mobility-Vth in amorphous IGZO. We establish the existence of a universal mobility-Vth trade-off across diverse IGZO compositions and channel thicknesses. To unveil the origin of the universal trend, we developed a mobility model that covers the full composition and thickness of a-IGZO with composition-resolved parameters using DFT and MLP, taking into account its stochastically and structurally driven variation of the amorphous material's properties. We found that the origin of the mobility-Vth trade-off is the strong dependence of both mobility and Vth on the carrier concentration. Despite the existence of the mobility-Vth trade-off, as a method for designing enhancement-mode devices with high mobility, we propose increasing the Zn content to reduce the structural disorder.},

  abstract = {In this work, the contact-doping effect (CDE) and its impact on the threshold voltage ( V\_\textbackslash text T ) roll-off in indium oxide (In2O3) field-effect transistors (FETs) are systematically studied. By analyzing the long channel length ( L \_\textbackslash text ch ) and short L\_\textbackslash text ch devices separately using a modified transfer length method (TLM), \textbackslash boldsymbol \textbackslash Delta L can be extracted to quantify the CDE. The correlation between \textbackslash Delta L and the L\_\textbackslash text ch at which V\_\textbackslash text T roll-off occurs suggests that CDE may be a key factor contributing to the V\_\textbackslash text T roll-off in In2O3 transistors. Next, the underlying mechanisms of CDE are investigated. It is found that oxygen scavenging reactions (OSRs) during the deposition of source/drain (S/D) metals on the In2O3 channel is one of the reasons behind CDE. S/D metals can scavenge oxygen atoms from In2O3, creating oxygen vacancies and increasing the carrier density near the S/D regions. Additionally, the Schottky barrier height ( \textbackslash boldsymbol \textbackslash Phi \_\textbackslash text SB ) of metal/In2O3 contacts might also influence the CDE: a positive \textbackslash boldsymbol \textbackslash Phi \_\textbackslash text SB depletes carriers, while a negative \textbackslash boldsymbol \textbackslash Phi \_\textbackslash text SB accumulates them in the In2O3 channel under the S/D. This study provides a new approach to investigating CDE and highlights its critical role in understanding the V\_\textbackslash text T roll-off in oxide semiconductor (OS) transistors.},

The robustness of In2O3 channel under hightemperature treatment is confirmed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and good electrical characteristics of drain current of 350 {$\mu$}A/{$\mu$}m (at VDS = 2 V), threshold voltage (VT) \textasciitilde{} 1 V, and low off-current \textasciitilde{} 10-14 A/{$\mu$}m determined by measurement detection limit in scaled devices with a channel length of 100 nm. Reliability characteristics of the devices are found to change with different process temperatures and can be explained by the proposed trap distribution model at the dielectric/In2O3 interface. This research indicates that top-gate E-mode In2O3 FETs with high-thermal budget and ultra-low offcurrent could find their promise to replace single crystal silicon channel for next-generation DRAM technology.},

In this paper, we propose a methodology to evaluate chip-level defect probabilities and thermal bottlenecks, followed by a physical layout optimization strategy. Our framework integrates multi-environment virtual metrology with a neural-network-based 3D real-time TCAD model, enabling the analysis of billions of geometries and thermal hotspots for simultaneous yield and performance optimization. Validated on a modest HPC cluster, our full-chip simulation completes in under an hour. This study extends the role of TCAD from device-level analysis to chip-level design, linking performance and yield interactions and establishing a new milestone in the DTCO paradigm.},

Here, it is revealed that oxidation of 2H-MoTe2 proceeds rapidly through defect-driven pathways on insulating layers, whereas metallic contacts strongly suppress such degradation during extended ambient exposure. This suppression arises from the rapid delocalization of oxidation-induced carriers into the metallic layer, as confirmed by first-principles calculations showing long-range electronic perturbations, which lowers local reactivity and favors gradual basal-plane oxidation. To further elucidate the role of oxygen and moisture during ambient aging, controlled exposures to these species are performed, revealing that oxygen primarily drives basal-plane oxidation while moisture accelerates defect-site corrosion.

However, the lack of a reliable method for creating high-quality, large-scale p-type 2D semiconductors and a suitable metallization process represents important challenges that need to be addressed for future developments of the field. Here, we report the fabrication of scalable p-type 2D single-crystalline 2H-MoTe2 transistor arrays with Fermi-level-tuned 1T'-phase semimetal contact electrodes. By transforming polycrystalline 1T'-MoTe2 to 2H polymorph via abnormal grain growth, we fabricated 4-inch 2H-MoTe2 wafers with ultra-large single-crystalline domains and spatially-controlled single-crystalline arrays at a low temperature (\textasciitilde 500\,{$^\circ$}C). Furthermore, we demonstrate on-chip transistors by lithographic patterning and layer-by-layer integration of 1T' semimetals and 2H semiconductors. Work function modulation of 1T'-MoTe2 electrodes was achieved by depositing 3D metal (Au) pads, resulting in minimal contact resistance (\textasciitilde 0.7 k\textohm{$\cdot\mu$}m) and near-zero Schottky barrier height (\textasciitilde 14 meV) of the junction interface, and leading to high on-state current (\textasciitilde 7.8 {$\mu$}A/{$\mu$}m) and on/off current ratio (\textasciitilde 105) in the 2H-MoTe2 transistors.},
